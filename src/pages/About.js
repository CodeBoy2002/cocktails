        The origins of the word "cocktail" have been debated (see section §
        Etymology). The first written mention of "cocktail" as a beverage
        appeared in The Farmers Cabinet, 1803 in the United States. The first
        definition of a cocktail as an alcoholic beverage appeared three years
        later in The Balance and Columbian Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13,
        1806.[4] Traditionally, cocktail ingredients included spirits, sugar,
        water and bitters,[5] however, this definition evolved throughout the
        1800s, to include the addition of a liqueur.
